# AI Synthesis Activity – Activity A (Used AI)

## 1. How I used AI
I used ChatGPT to help me scaffold a TypeScript project from scratch, set up Zod validation, configure Jest, ESLint, Prettier, and to build a CLI. I also used it to debug TypeScript and Jest errors.

## 2. Why I used AI
I used AI because I had gaps in my knowledge around project configuration and wiring together TypeScript, Zod, Jest, and ESLint without starter code. AI gave me structured guidance when documentation alone felt overwhelming.

## 3. Evaluation of one AI response
One of the most helpful responses was the implementation of the `validatePizza` function using Zod and a discriminated union return type. The response was mostly accurate and worked after small adjustments for my Zod version. I reviewed and tested the code instead of blindly copying it.

## 4. New or unfamiliar concepts learned
- Zod schema validation and `safeParse`
- Discriminated union return types
- Node `parseArgs` for CLI arguments
- Using Jest with `ts-jest` for testing TypeScript
